🔥 Project Dynamo: The Ultimate Project Management Companion 🔥

A revolutionary, open-source solution meticulously engineered to elevate your team's collaboration
and productivity to new heights.

Project Dynamo is more than just a task tracker; it's a comprehensive, real-time platform built to
streamline every aspect of your project lifecycle. By leveraging a powerful, modern tech
stack—Flutter on the frontend and Supabase for the backend—we deliver a seamless, intuitive, and
data-driven experience that keeps your entire team in sync, no matter where they are.
🌟 Why Project Dynamo? 🌟

In a world saturated with project management tools, Project Dynamo stands out by offering:

    True Cross-Platform Native Experience: Built with Flutter, enjoy fluid animations and a consistent UI across all platforms, not just a web wrapper.

    Real-time First Architecture: Powered by Supabase, collaboration is instantaneous. No more manual refreshes to see the latest updates.

    Data Import Simplicity: Get started in seconds by importing existing project data from .csv or .xlsx files.

    Open Source & Community Driven: Transparency in development and the ability for you to contribute and shape its future.

    Focus on Core Project Management: We prioritize the essential features that drive project success without overwhelming users with unnecessary complexity.

✨ Core Features: Engineered for Your Success ✨

    🚀 Dynamic Task Import & Creation: Say goodbye to manual data entry. Instantly populate projects and tasks by importing .csv and .xlsx files. This is a game-changer for project setup, saving valuable time and ensuring data consistency from the start.

    💡 Real-time Collaboration & Communication: Experience effortless teamwork with our real-time synchronization. Every task update, status change, and comment appears instantly across all connected devices. The integrated comments section allows for centralized, transparent communication, eliminating scattered emails and chat messages.

    📊 Actionable Data Visualization: Gain a clear, visual understanding of your project's health and team performance. Built-in charts (via fl_chart) and interactive data grids (via syncfusion_flutter_datagrid) transform raw data into actionable insights, helping you identify trends, track progress, and make informed decisions at a glance.

    🎨 Intuitive, Adaptive User Experience: Our UI, designed with a "less is more" philosophy, is clean, modern, and uncluttered. Built with Flutter, the interface adapts flawlessly to any screen size—from smartphones to large desktop monitors—ensuring a consistent and professional feel.

    🔒 Secure & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Security is paramount. Project Dynamo features robust, role-based access control leveraging Supabase Auth, with distinct user profiles for Admin, Manager, and Employee. This ensures every team member has the precise level of access required, protecting sensitive project data.

    🌐 Universal Cross-Platform Compatibility: Developed from a single Flutter codebase, Project Dynamo runs natively on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and the web. Access and manage your projects from any device, anywhere, without compromising performance or functionality.

    🔔 Notifications: Get notified about important task updates, mentions, or deadlines.

    🔍 Advanced Search/Filtering: Filter tasks by assignee, due date, status, tags, etc., with complex query support.

🛠️ How It Works: A Technical Overview 🛠️

Project Dynamo's architecture is a testament to modern software engineering principles, combining a
powerful Flutter frontend with a scalable, real-time Supabase backend.

    Frontend (Flutter): The user interface is built using Flutter (Dart), Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase. We utilize the Provider pattern for elegant and efficient state management, ensuring a predictable data flow throughout the application. Key UI interactions are designed to be intuitive, leveraging Flutter's rich widget library and animation capabilities.

    Backend (Supabase): The backend is powered by Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative. We leverage its:

        PostgreSQL Database: For robust and scalable data storage. Supabase provides direct SQL access and a user-friendly interface for schema management.

        Supabase Auth: For secure user authentication (email/password, OAuth providers - if you plan to add them) and management, including Row Level Security (RLS) policies to enforce data access rules at the database level.

        Realtime Engine: For instant data synchronization across all clients using WebSockets. Changes in the database are broadcast to subscribed clients, making collaborative features seamless.

        Storage: For storing imported files, task attachments, or user avatars via Supabase Storage.

        Edge Functions: For server-side logic like sending email notifications or complex data transformations.

This BaaS (Backend as a Service) approach allows us to focus on building core application features
rather than managing complex server infrastructure.
🚀 Getting Started with Project Dynamo 🚀

Follow these steps to set up and run Project Dynamo on your local system.

1. System Prerequisites:

   Flutter SDK: Ensure you have the latest stable Flutter SDK installed (e.g., 3.13.x or newer).

   Validate your setup: Use flutter doctor.

   Supabase Account: Create or log into your account at Supabase.io.

   Set up a new Project within Supabase and retrieve your Project URL and anon public Key from
   Project Settings > API.

   Git: Required for cloning the project repository.

2. Project Setup:

   Clone the Repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-dynamo.git
   cd project-dynamo

   Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root of the project-dynamo directory.
   Add your Supabase credentials:

   SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY

   Important: Add .env to your .gitignore file to protect your credentials.

   Install Dependencies:

   flutter pub get

3. Platform Configuration (Optional for Desktop):

   If you plan to run on desktop platforms and haven't enabled them:

   flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
   flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
   flutter config --enable-linux-desktop

4. Launch Project Dynamo:

   Run the Application:

   flutter run

   To target a specific device or platform: Use flutter devices to list available IDs, then:

   flutter run -d <deviceId>

   (e.g., flutter run -d chrome, flutter run -d windows)

You're all set! Project Dynamo should now be running.
