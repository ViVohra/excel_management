🛠️ How It Works: A Technical Overview

Project Dynamo's architecture is a testament to modern software engineering principles, combining a
powerful frontend with a scalable, real-time backend.

    Frontend (Flutter): The user interface is built using Flutter, a reactive framework that allows for a single codebase to target multiple platforms. It uses the Provider pattern for state management, ensuring a predictable and efficient data flow throughout the app.

    Backend (Supabase): The backend is powered by Supabase, a cloud-based platform that provides all the tools we need out-of-the-box. We leverage its PostgreSQL database for data storage, Supabase Auth for secure user management, and most importantly, its Realtime engine for instant data synchronization. This allows us to focus on building features rather than managing complex server infrastructure.
